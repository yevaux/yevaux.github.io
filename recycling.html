				<p class="subsection_title">DESIGN PROBLEM</p>

				<p>"Clothing recycling" refers to converting clothes into reusable fibers, which is different from donating or reselling clothes.</p><br>
				
				<p>In King County, WA, about 95% of clothing articles disposed into landfills could instead be recycled. We believe there is lack of awareness and communication between households, business community, and local governments around recycling clothing.</p><br>
				
				<p>The project aimed to investigate why people don’t recycle their clothes more often, explore the ways to educate people on the benefits of clothing recycling, and design solutions to increase habitual clothing recycling.</p>

				<p class="subsection_title">DESIGN QUESTION</p>

				<blockquote>How might we help households in King County recycle their clothes with ease and purpose?</blockquote>

				<p class="subsection_title">METHODS</p>

				<p>Our research kicked off with a comprehensive <b><i>Competitive Product Survey</i></b>. We thoroughly researched the problem space to understand the nature and limitations of the current clothing recycling options available on the market, both nationally and internationally. Simultaneously, we conducted <b><i>Historical Analysis</i></b> by reviewing and documenting existing literature and academic research on the subject. In addition, we reached out to several King County officials to obtain the latest research materials from the county database as a part of our Secondary Analysis method.</p><br>

				<p>Next, we created a comprehensive, 24-question <b><i>Online Survey</i></b> and distributed it through the University of Washington affiliated Facebook groups, Slack channels, and among the Human-Centered Design and Engineering department students. Additionally, the survey was shared through multiple King County neighborhood Facebook groups, including the Beacon Hill <i>Buy Nothing</i>, to access a wider audience. 159 responses were collected and analyzed.</p><br>

				<p>Next, we conducted our <b><i>Contextual Inquiry</i></b> by visiting a Goodwill store located in the Dearborn neighborhood of Seattle, and a Goodwill Outlet located nearby. We assessed the location, observed and documented the donation process, and examined the interior of both stores.</p><br>

							</div>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<p>Additionally, we interviewed 7 Goodwill customer groups ranging from individual shoppers to families.</p><br>

				<p>For our <b><i>Individual Interviews</i></b>, we conducted 3 in-depth interviews of 2 female and 1 male University of Washington graduate students at their homes and assessed their closet space. To venture a step further, we also interviewed an <b><i>Extreme User</i></b>, a clothing industry expert, at her home.</p><br>

				<p>To triangulate our research efforts even more, we employed the <b><i>Empathy Tools</i></b> method to evaluate every step of the Goodwill donation process and to understand the <i>Give Back Box</i> clothing recycling process.</p><br>

				<p>Finally, we recruited a participant to photo-document her clothing recycling process for our <b><i>Still Photo Diary</i></b> method. The findings were recorded in a 12-slide power point presentation.</p>

							<p>Our research highlighted 3 fundamental issues related to clothing recycling: a vast majority of the participants was not familiar with the “clothing recycling” concept per se, struggled to identify the types of clothes that could be recycled, and had a hard time locating a clothing recycling venue.</p><br>

							<ol>
								<li>"Clothing recycling" to many either meant nothing at all or implied domestic reuse (e.g. cleaning rags) and gifting unwanted garments to family members instead of remanufacturing.</li>
								<li>The respondents were frequently confused by the types of clothes suitable for recycling (e.g. single socks, old underwear pieces) and cited a lack of awareness as one of the main reasons they had not recycled clothes in the past.</li>
								<li>Finally, very few participants could point a specific location to take their unwanted garments to and repeatedly mentioned Goodwill as a venue accepting clothing donations that would later be resold or recycled.</li>

							<p id="subtitle"><u><b>Qualitative Highlights</b></u>:</p><br>

							<p>Many had behaviors of donating clothing, but a lack of awareness was a main reason why those respondents had not recycled clothes in the past. Specifically, interviewees were largely unfamiliar with what clothing can be recycled, as well as where and how it can be done.</p><br>

							<p>Participants were willing, and even excited, to be educated on the subject throughout our research process. They were eager to reduce their clothing waste impact.</p><br>

							<p>Above all, interviewees said that recycling needed to be convenient for their households.</p>

				<p class="subsection_title">PERSONAS</p>

				<p>Our <b><i>primary target users</i></b> were those who donate frequently and either do not recycle or recycle selectively. These are households that might be motivated to recycle clothing instead of putting them into the trash. They are unfamiliar with what clothing can be recycled, as well as where and how it can be done. Recycling convenience is a key need for these households.</p><br>

				<p>Our <b><i>secondary target users</i></b> were those who infrequently donate and do not recycle. These households are not motivated to dispose of clothing in more conscious ways and thus need to be informed about the consequences of trashing clothing and its impact on the environment. They are unfamiliar with the different ways to donate and recycle clothing.</p><br>

				<p class="section_title" id="prototyping_usability">Prototyping & Usability Testing</p>

				<p class="subsection_title">IDEA SELECTION</p>

				<p>We chose an app solution because it covered all of our design requirements, and most importantly, it would educate users about clothing recycling and help them conveniently initiate the process.</p>

				<p class="subsection_title">LOW FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</p>

				<p>We created a <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/EHPC005RT3M#/screens" target="_blank">first iteration of our clothing recycling app</a> using InVision Freehand.</p><br>

			<div class="col-1-wrapper">
				<p class="subsection_title">USABILITY TESTING METHODOLOGY</p>

				<p>Our team tested our recycling app design with 7 users who represented a fairly diverse professional and age spectrum. Specifically, the male and female participants were comprised of 1 graduate student, 5 professionals and 1 retired individual. The participants’ technical expertise and domain knowledge ranged from advanced to very basic.</p><br>

				<p>The first 2 tests were conducted in a classroom setting using an iterative low-fi black and white InVision prototype presented on an iPhone. The subsequent 5 tests took place in the Beacon Hill neighborhood in Seattle using both our low-fi as well as our medium-high interactive InVision color prototype presented on a Mac laptop. The usability testing team consisted of a moderator interacting in-person with the participants and an observer responsible for note-taking.</p>

				<p class="subsection_title">KEY FINDINGS</p>

				<ol id="key_findings">
					<li>App tour was confusing for users</li>
					<li>Recycle Cart was found to be unnecessary</li>
					<li>Purpose of the gamification points was unclear</li>
					<li>Desire to know what happens to recycled items</li>
					<li>Prototype did not cater to international users</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="subsection_title">HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</p>

				<p>Improvements made from low fidelity prototype:</p><br>

				<ul>
					<li>Streamlined the overall experience</li>
					<li>Added an onboarding experience that articulates what “clothing recycling” is as well as the process</li>
					<li>Replaced the “trip” and “cart” verbiage with more appropriate terminology to avoid misuses of common terms</li>
					<li>Removed the Recycle Cart experience</li>

				<p>The <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/prototype/cjp3uch1700whhk01lp7s7ti0/play" target="blank">final design</a> was created using InVision Studio. Finishing touches included:</p><br>

				<ul>
					<li>Adding app onboarding experience as many users were confused about what the app was about</li>
					<li>Altering gamification from earning points to tracking how many pounds of clothing users are diverting from the landfill</li>
					<li>Introducing localized options that match King County’s most commonly spoken languages</li>
