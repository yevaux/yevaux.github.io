				<p class="section_title">Summary</p>

				<p class="subsection_title">BACKGROUND</p>

				<p>In the United States, prolonged working hours, lack of free time, and increased purchasing power of consumers have changed the way many Americans eat. Currently, popular food consumption habits and trends among individuals and households have led to a rise in non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Subsequently, consumer concern for wellness is at an all-time high, and food retailers are being referred to as the “last line of defense” in the obesity war.</p><br>
				
				<p>Yet with healthy eating now a priority for many shoppers, how do consumers know what products are healthy, and how do they make their purchase decisions? Some manufacturers have adopted a Front-of-Package (FOP) labeling system because of two motivating factors. The first is to help inform shoppers of healthy products. The second is in shopper marketing, or marketing to customers through the use of FOP label designs.</p><br>
				
				<p><b>In an attempt to provide empirical evidence on the effects of different labeling systems on consumer perception of health, this study aimed to investigate the effects of different packaging nutrition label information on perceived healthiness.</b></p>

				<p class="section_title" id="title_bottom">Hypothesis</p>

				<p>We hypothesized that displaying a Per Serving or Per Box clarification note on the FOP label would affect consumers’ perception of the healthiness of the food products shown in this study.</p><br>

				<div class="img-wrap">

				<p>FOP label constituted an <i>independent variable</i>. Perceived healthiness of a food item was the <i>dependent variable</i>.</p>

				<p class="section_title">Study Design</p>

				<p class="subsection_title">METHOD</p>

				<p>A true <b>between-subjects experimental design</b> was used for this study.</p><br>

				<p>All participants were presented with a survey of 8 images of individual food packages, followed by a corresponding 7-point Likert scale (from <i>Very Unhealthy</i> to <i>Very Healthy</i>) to measure perceived healthiness. Unaltered images were presented to the Control group; the photoshopped Per Serving or Per Box labels were added to the images for the experimental conditions.</p><br>

				<p>To avoid creating a misinformed bias towards foods with added vitamins and minerals, our label purely displayed calories, protein, fat and carbohydrate content.</p><br>

				<!--<p class="subsection_title">INFLUENCES OF GENDER</p>

				<p>The two-way ANOVA of participants’ gender and group on perceived healthiness for each food package resulted in the data not being statistically significant with a significance threshold of p < 0.05.</p><br>

				<div class="img-wrap">
					<img src="img/influences_of_gender.jpg" alt="">
				</div>

				<p>We continued our investigation into the effects of participants’ gender by comparing the male and female populations. For this, we first considered the Likert scale data to be <i>interval</i> and the score distribution to be <i>parametric</i>. We then conducted a two-tailed t-test to compare male and female populations, which yielded p = 0.87 and thus the data being not statistically significant.</p><br>

				<p>To be conservative with our calculations, we also considered the Likert scale data to be <i>ordinal</i> and the score distribution to be <i>non-parametric</i>. We then conducted a Mann-Whitney U test to compare male and female populations, which also was not statistically significant.</p><br>

				<p class="subsection_title">INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION</p>

				<p>A two-way ANOVA was applied in RStudio to assess the influence of participants’ education level on perceived healthiness as well as their interactions. The first factor in the two-way ANOVA was the group and the second was level of education. The data for each food package resulted in the data not being statistically significant with a significance threshold of p < 0.05, though Sweet Tea came close at p = 0.0522.</p><br>

				<p class="subsection_title">INFLUENCES OF INCOME</p>

				<p>A two-way ANOVA was applied in RStudio to assess the influence of participants’ income on the group as well as their interactions. The first factor in the two-way ANOVA was the group and the second was income range. The data for each food package resulted in most of the data not being statistically significant with a significance threshold of p < 0.05.</p><br>

				<p>The interaction of the group and income range of the Cereal package proved to have a statistically significant effect on perceived healthiness, with p = 0.025. Also, the group value of the two-way ANOVA of the Oreos package proved to have a statistically significant effect on perceived healthiness, with p = 0.037.</p><br>

				<p class="subsection_title">INFLUENCES OF AGE</p>

				<p>A two-way ANOVA was applied in RStudio to assess the influence of participants’ age on the group as well as their interactions. The first factor in the two-way ANOVA was the group and the second was age range. The data for each food package resulted in the data not being statistically significant with a significance threshold of p < 0.05, though Quiche came relatively close at p = 0.0677.</p><br>

				<p class="subsection_title">INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS</p>

				<p>While our study did not produce statistically significant results overall, we were able to make some interesting observations from our data.</p><br>

				<table>
					<tr>
						<td id="left">
							<ol>
								<li id="observations">The product rated the most healthy was Trail Mix, with a mean score of 4.15 across groups, and the most unhealthy was Oreos with a mean score of 1.63</li>
								<li id="observations">Cereal was rated exactly the same across all groups with a mean of 4.00</li>
								<li id="observations">Quiche was the only food item with lower means in the Per Serving and Per Box groups than in the Control group</li>
							</ol>
						</td>
						<td id="right">
							<ol>
								<li id="observations">Some interesting demographic results were that those with a high school education rated all food the lowest, or most unhealthy, at a mean of 2.89, and doctorates rated the foods the healthiest at 4.00</li>
								<li id="observations">Respondents making less than $19,000 annually rated all foods higher on average than other groups</li>
							</ol>

				<p class="section_title" id="title_bottom">Discussion</p>

				<p>Through the 384 data points we analyzed, we concluded that the FOP labels do not affect consumers perception of the healthiness of a food. <b><i>This led us to a larger question: what is the most important factor in a consumer’s perception of a nutritional label? The label design or the consumer’s prior knowledge of nutrition</i></b>?</p><br>

				<p>Our outcomes are consistent with the larger criticisms against food package labeling. There are many studies that criticize not only the design of FOP labels, but the guidelines and regulations (or lack thereof) surrounding them. Specifically, Graham et al. (2016) produced a similar study with a comparable result of FOP labeling leading to more healthful food choices not being supported. Further, Soederberg, Miller, and Cassady (2015) determined that prior knowledge of nutrition is not taken into account in many of the studies that are conducted on food labels, but nutrition knowledge is paramount in making healthy food choices.</p>

				<p class="subsection_title">STUDY LIMITATIONS</p>

				<p>Some limitations that may impact the larger applicability of our research are the platform and the data collection method we used.</p><br>

				<p>The platform we used for recruitment, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, is known for having participants whose work method is governed by speed of test completion instead of intrinsic motivation to advance science. This could have affected the honesty of participants’ responses – answers made quickly instead of honestly.</p><br>

				<p>Another limitation of using a crowdsourcing platform is the lack of ability to dive deeper into and follow up on participants’ perception and attention (i.e. have they actually noticed the FOP labels?).</p><br>

				<p>Finally, due to conducting an unmoderated, remote survey, we did not have the ability to follow up with participants and ask further questions about their decisions or if they noticed the label. Future studies can either be conducted in person or expand the survey to test for these factors.</p>

				<p class="subsection_title">FUTURE DESIGN IMPLICATIONS</p>

				<p>The results of our study and similar studies hint at a larger issue of a lack of consumer knowledge of nutrition. More diverse research in consumer knowledge and motivation should be taken into account. Future experiments could include:</p><br>

				<ul>
					<li>Performing the experiment in a physical grocery store</li>
					<li>Different FOP placement, content, color scheme, visual design, and font variation</li>
					<li>Labels with “Organic”, “Low Carb”, or specific diet terms (e.g. “Keto”, “Vegan”)</li>
					<li>Food package placement on shelves (front of package, nutrition label facing front)</li>
					<li>Testing for nutrition knowledge before the study</li>
				</ul>
